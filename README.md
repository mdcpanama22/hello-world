This is testing out how git-hub works.

I am aspiring towards creating a more meaningful experience with games, and story telling in virtual reality, and also increasing the accesibility of infomration for those who are handicapped. I am currently a second semester sophomore in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, studying computer science, and working on my portfolio to apply for a dual with GSAS (Games and Simulation Art and Science).
